Project Description
This project aims to create a dynamic dashboard with real-time clock display, date information, and personalized messages based on the time of day. The dashboard also includes navigation elements for accessing different sections of the application, such as links, weather information, and password management.

Features
Real-time Clock: The dashboard prominently displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds.

Date Information: Alongside the clock, the dashboard shows the current date in day/month/year format.

Personalized Messages: Depending on the time of day, the dashboard presents custom messages to the user. These messages change dynamically, providing a friendly and engaging user experience.

Navigation Menu: The navigation menu allows users to access different sections of the dashboard, including links, weather information, and password management. Each section is represented by an icon and a tooltip.

Toggle Clock Visibility: Users can toggle the visibility of the clock section by clicking on the clock icon in the navigation menu.

Implementation Details
HTML Structure: The dashboard layout is structured using HTML, with separate sections for the clock, navigation menu, and other content areas.

CSS Styling: Styling is applied using CSS to enhance the visual appearance of the dashboard, including font styles, colors, and layout adjustments.
